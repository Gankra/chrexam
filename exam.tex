Welcome to the third year of the ongoing tradition of making Beingessner(s)
Edward and Holly work for the Christmas presents they receive from
Beingessner(s) Julia, Sonia and Alexis, and Collymore, Mike.
\vspace{1cm}

This year, the challenge is a multi-subject exam. Each point earned on the exam
is equal to 50 Canadian cents. A total of 120 points can be earned on the exam
proper, and there are also bonus questions.
\vspace{1cm}

Only one test may be taken per examinee. Examinees may not communicate with each
other, or with anyone other than the official exam proctors (Beingessner(s)
Julia, Sonia and Alexis, and Collymore, Mike). All electronic devices will be
confiscated, including laptops, tablets, desktop computers, fancy watches, time
machines, cellphones, etc.

Cheating on the exam will disqualify the examinee from receiving any money.

This exam is open book. The following resources may be used:

\section{History}

\subsection{Multiple Choice (1 point each)}

\begin{enumerate}



\item Some historians love to say that before World War One, ``Europe was a
\underline{\hspace{2cm}} keg.'' Julia thinks that these kinds of historians

\begin{enumerate}
\item History is just the dates of battles and names of kings, and that’s all been written down.
\item It’s impossible to prove what actually happened in the past.

\item A branch of feminism focused on investigating and explaining the ways in which women
are oppressed through systems of capitalism and private property.
\item A branch of Marxism focused on investigating and explaining the ways in which women
oppress men through systems of culture and withholding goods.
\item A branch of economics focused on investigating and explaining the ways in which
women disrupt financial systems by entering the workforce, due to the added strain on
social services such as child care.
\item Literally the worst.
\end{enumerate}

"Specially prepared for human therapeutic purposes, medicinal maggots are fly larvae. The utilization of Medicinal Maggots are sometimes referred to as "Maggot Debridement Therapy," "Larval Therapy", or "Biosurgery". Certain specie of maggots have been used -- as an alt to surgery -- to treat non-healing and infected wounds. They secrete an enzyme in order to digest necrotic tissue. Medicinal leeches are fresh water annelids that; specially prepared for Human therapeutic purposes. Theuse of medicinal Leeches is sometimes : referred to as "Hirudotherapy".  Certain species of leechs have been used by chirugeons after re-attachment surgery (such as finger reattachment) and applied to healing graft tissues to help flow. They secrete hirudin, which is a powerful anticoagulant, to do so."

\question[6] Determine the roots and critical points of $x^2 + x - 2$, and plot
it.
\vfill




\newpage
\question Recall that a number is said to be \emph{even} if it can be written
as $2k$, for \emph{some} integer $k$. Similarly, a number is \emph{odd} if it
can be written as $2k + 1$. For instance, $18 = 2(9)$, and $15 = 2(7) + 1$.

We can use these definitions to prove how integers change under certain
transformations. For instance, we can show that if $x$ is even, $x^2$ is even:

\begin{proof}
Because $x$ is even, we know that $x = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Therefore,
\[\begin{array}{rclr}
x^2 &=& (2k)^2 & (x = 2k) \\
&=& 4k^2 & \\
&=& 2(2k^2) & \\
\end{array}\]

$2k^2$ is an integer, so we have shown that $x^2$ is even.
\end{proof}

\part[3] Prove that if $x$ is even, $(x + 1)^2$ is odd

\section{Physics}
\setcounter{question}{0}

\question You fire a high-powered laser at a cat, which enters the cat's
eye. For our purposes, the eye and inside of the head can be assumed to be mostly
water.



\begin{parts}
\part[1] What law governs how the beam of light will behave when it enters the
cat's eye?
\\
\\

\part[2] Assuming the surface of the cat's eye is perpendicular to its brain,
do you expect the beam of light to bend towards the cat's brain and destroy it,
or bend away and save it? Why?
\vfill
\end{parts}





\newpage
\question[9] You plan to fire a cat from a trebuchet. Based on your calculations, the cat
will leave the trebuchet at a height of $4m$, travelling $10m/s$, at an angle of
$45$ degrees from the ground ($cos(45) = sin(45) = 0.7$). The cat weighs $1kg$,
is spherical, uniform, frictionless, and a perfect conductor. Gravity is $10m/s^2$

How far from the trebuchet should you place your lava pit to catch the cat? Note
that your lava pit is fairly large, and cats are dumb and will probably run into
it anyway, so precision isn't particularly important (i.e. feel free to approximate square
roots). We're more interested in
your methods.







\newpage
\question[3] Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton are in a fist fight. Each uses their
mastery of physics to amplify their blows. Einstein uses general relativity to
make his fists twice as massive on impact. Newton uses gravity wells to make them twice as
fast (but still punches as frequently). Who has the advantage, and why?
\vfill





\question[3] Bonus: If Newton's and Einstein's fists have a resting mass of 1kg and
originally punched at $1/10$th the speed of light, how does this change the situation?
